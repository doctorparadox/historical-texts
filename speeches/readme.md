* [Margaret Chase Smith, A Declaration of Conscience](https://github.com/doctorparadox/historical-texts/blob/master/speeches/Margaret-Chase-Smith-Declaration-of-Conscience.pdf) (1950) -- given on the Senate floor in response to the rise of [McCarthyism](https://foundations.doctorparadox.net/People/Joe+McCarthy) and anti-Communist hysteria in the 1950s

## "The German Element in America" (1944)

* [lundeen-germany-speech_sm.pdf](https://github.com/doctorparadox/historical-texts/blob/master/speeches/lundeen-germany-speech_sm.pdf)

The speech was written for Sen. Ernest Lundeen by a paid [Nazi](https://foundations.doctorparadox.net/Companies+and+Orgs/Nazis) agent. Lundeen was carrying these pages when he died mysteriously and suddenly in a plane crash,
and they were found near the scene of the accident. The speech extolled the great contributions of German culture to American life, 
and argued that Americans had more in common with the fascist German government than it did with the democracies Germany was busy invading.
