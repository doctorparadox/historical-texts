# DNC 2024 Speeches

The deep bench of the Democratic Party was on full display at this year's Democratic National Convention -- an event that 
brought a certain hopeful energy back to politics reminiscent of 2008 (and no surprise, given that both Obamas gave career-topping
speeches on the second night of the convention).

I'll aim to collect some of the many highlights here.
