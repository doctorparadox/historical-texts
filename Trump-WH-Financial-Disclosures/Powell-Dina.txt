Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Restricted Shares- I
currently hold RSUs that were granted to me as part
of my compensation for fiscal years 2014, 2015, and
2016. Under the terms of the awards, stock
underlying these awards is scheduled to be delivered
in 2018-2020. A portion will be delivered in Restricted
Shares. I also hold Restricted Shares associated with
RSU awards that were granted to me as part of my
compensation for fiscal years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014
and 2015. The restrictions on the Restricted Shares
generally remain in place for five years after the RSU
grant. The award agreements applicable to these
awards provide for accelerated settlement of the
RSUs and lifting of the transfer restrictions on the
Restricted Shares if I enter into certain types of
“conflicted employment.” I expect that the position of
Assistant to the President will be viewed by Goldman
Sachs as “conflicted employment.”

Shareholders Agreement - As a participating
managing director of Goldman Sachs I am subject to
a shareholders’ agreement which requires that I
retain a certain percentage of my Goldman Sachs
shares for so long as I remained a participating
managing director. The agreement also requires that
I participate in a voting arrangement with respect to
certain of my Goldman Sachs shares whereby such
shares are voted in accordance with the majority of
the shares voted by all the parties to the agreement.
All substantive obligations under the Shareholders’
Agreement will terminate when my employment as a
Goldman Sachs participating managing director
terminates.

Goldman Sachs Investment Fund Interests – I am
invested in certain private investment funds
established by Goldman Sachs to permit its
employees to participate in the firm's private equity,
hedge fund and other similar activities by investing in
or alongside funds and investments that the firm
manages or sponsors for independent investors
and/or for the firm. Certain of the funds provide
employee investors with an interest in the override
the firm receives for managing the funds, and/or are
offered to employee investors on a fee-free or
reduced fee basis. All such funds are disclosed in
Part 6 of this form.

401(k) Plan – I contributed a portion of my annual
compensation to a 401(k) plan. Pursuant to the terms
of the plan, I will cease to be eligible to participate in
the plan when my employment with Goldman Sachs
terminates. At that time, I will be permitted to retain
the account and direct the investment of the account
at my discretion. In addition, based on my 2016
employee contributions to the plan, I am entitled to a
2016 firm matching contribution in the amount of
$10,600, which will be allocated to my account during
the first quarter of 2017, and based on my 2017
contributions to the plan, I am entitled to a 2017 firm
matching contribution in an amount to be
determined, which will be allocated to my account
during the first quarter of 2018.
