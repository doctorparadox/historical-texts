# historical-texts
I'm creating this repository as a way to store historical texts I've collated from various sources into one place, where I can annotate them, 
retrieve them from anywhere or any device, and share them more widely with anyone else who might find them useful.

I've used some in NLP and ChatGPT projects already and plan to use the wider collection for further historical analysis. I find it a lot easier to work with the collection in "published" form versus organizing folders on my desktop -- and hope other folks can get some value out of centralizing these
works as well.
