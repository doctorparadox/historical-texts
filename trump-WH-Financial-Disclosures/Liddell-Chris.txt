 Summary of Contents
1. Filer's Positions Held Outside United States Government
Part 1 discloses positions that the filer held at any time during the reporting period (excluding positions with the United States Government). Positions are reportable
even if the filer did not receive compensation.
This section does not include the following: (1) positions with religious, social, fraternal, or political organizations; (2) positions solely of an honorary nature; (3) positions
held as part of the filer's official duties with the United States Government; (4) mere membership in an organization; and (5) passive investment interests as a limited

Part 2 discloses the following:
●

●

Sources of earned and other non-investment income of the filer totaling more than $200 during the reporting period (e.g., salary, fees, partnership share,
honoraria, scholarships, and prizes)
Assets related to the filer's business, employment, or other income-generating activities that (1) ended the reporting period with a value greater than $1,000 or (2)
produced more than $200 in income during the reporting period (e.g., equity in business or partnership, stock options, retirement plans/accounts and their
underlying holdings as appropriate, deferred compensation, and intellectual property, such as book deals and patents)

This section does not include assets or income from United States Government employment or assets that were acquired separately from the filer's business,
employment, or other income-generating activities (e.g., assets purchased through a brokerage account). Note: The type of income is not required if the amount of
income is $0 - $200 or if the asset qualifies as an excepted investment fund (EIF).

a company's profits, etc.)

4. Filer's Sources of Compensation Exceeding $5,000 in a Year
Part 4 discloses sources (except the United States Government) that paid more than $5,000 in a calendar year for the filer's services during any year of the reporting
period.

 The filer discloses payments both from employers and from any clients to whom the filer personally provided services. The filer discloses a source even if the source
made its payment to the filer's employer and not to the filer. The filer does not disclose a client's payment to the filer's employer if the filer did not provide the services
for which the client is paying.
5. Spouse's Employment Assets & Income and Retirement Accounts
Part 5 discloses the following:
