A [recent indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice](https://github.com/doctorparadox/historical-texts/blob/master/russia-investigations/sdny/gov.uscourts.nysd.627696.2.0.pdf), unsealed on Sept 3, 2024, accuses two Russian nationals -- employees of the state-owned media outlet RT -- of funding a covert operation aimed at spreading Kremlin propaganda in the U.S. through popular right-wing influencers. The indictment alleges that RT funneled nearly $10 million through a Tennessee-based media company, identified as Tenet Media, to finance social media content that aligned with Russia's interests. 

Influencers such as Tim Pool and Benny Johnson claim to have been unaware of the Russian backing behind Tenet Media, which aimed to amplify domestic divisions in the U.S., especially around issues like the Ukraine war. The Justice Department claims this effort was part of an ongoing broader attempt by Russia to interfere with the upcoming U.S. elections by exploiting unwitting influencers to spread divisive content -- a strategy they have been employing with arguably great success since (at least) 2016.
