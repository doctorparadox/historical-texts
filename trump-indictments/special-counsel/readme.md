This folder contains documents relating to the Jack Smith Special Counsel investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election to stay in power, including the insurrection events of January 6. Smith has charged Trump on 4 counts: 3 conspiracy charges and one obstruction of a federal proceeding:

1. conspiracy  to defraud the United States
2. conspiracy to obstruct an official government proceeding
3. conspiracy to deprive people of civil rights provided by federal law or the Constitution
4. attempting to obstruct an official proceeding â€” the certification of the election results by Congress

Jack Smith has another case against Trump, regarding the theft of classified documents [taken unlawfully from the White House to Mar-a-Lago](https://github.com/doctorparadox/historical-texts/tree/master/trump-indictments/classified-documents).

**(10/2/24):** [Jack Smith has filed new documentation](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jack-smith-election-fraud-evidence-white-house-steve-bannon-1963105) in response to the Supreme Court's ruling granting presidential immunity for "official acts," arguing that Donald Trump the candidate was acting as a private citizen at the time of his crimes to secure the presidency in 2020. The document is over 80MB so too large to upload directly here in GitHub, so I will [link to it directly instead](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/73357920e3c8d739/8fc8bfd0-full.pdf).

**(10/19/24):** Judge Tanya Chutkan unseals the 4 volume appendix to Jack Smith's 165-page new coup filing against Trump following the SCOTUS immunity ruling. Each file is too big for GitHub so I will [link to the whole collection here](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/chutkan-unseals-four-volume-appendix-to-smith-s-165-page-immunity-filing).
